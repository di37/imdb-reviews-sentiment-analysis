# Training an IMDB Movie Sentiment Analyzer Using TensorFlow and Transformers

This project demonstrates how to use Transformer-based models for sentiment analysis of movie reviews from the IMDB dataset. Transformers, a cutting-edge architecture for NLP tasks, provide contextual understanding of text, enabling highly accurate sentiment classification. TensorFlow and Keras libraries were used to build, train, and evaluate the model.

## Environment

The whole experiment was done in Colab notebook. Tensorflow library was used.

## Machine Learning

The pre-processing and feature engineering is almost the same except padding was done. The whole experiment was done in `Full_Assignment_Transformers_IMDB_Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb` from Data Ingestion till Prediction Pipeline.

## Results
Evaluation using test dataset as follows:

235/235 - 11s - loss: 0.2903 - accuracy: 0.8815 - 11s/epoch - 47ms/step
loss: 0.290
accuracy: 0.881
