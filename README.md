# Training Transformers Model for IMDB Sentiment Analysis

We can notice that transformers model was trained faster than Bi-directional LSTM model and also gave better result.

## Environment

The whole experiment was done in Colab notebook. Tensorflow library was used.

## Machine Learning

The pre-processing and feature engineering is almost the same except padding was done. The whole experiment was done in `Full_Assignment_Transformers_IMDB_Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb` from Data Ingestion till Prediction Pipeline.

## Results
Evaluation using test dataset as follows:

235/235 - 11s - loss: 0.2903 - accuracy: 0.8815 - 11s/epoch - 47ms/step
loss: 0.290
accuracy: 0.881
